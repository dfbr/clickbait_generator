From the supplied headlines, choose one and based on the headline, create a humorous, uplifting clickbait story. Be careful to be positive about all people mentioned in the story. Include funny quotes and unexpected elements to the story. Return the story as a json payload with two elements: the headline and the story.
The story should be in markdown format ready to be converted to a web page and be around 300-700 words. Include images if there are relevant images with public use allowed (in which case include the relevant attribution too)
If required, tidy up the spelling and grammar in the headline before returning it.
