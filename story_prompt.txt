From the supplied headlines, choose one and based on the headline, create a humorous, uplifting clickbait story. Be careful to be positive about all people mentioned in the story. Include funny quotes and unexpected elements to the story and, if appropriate for the story being told, there should be an unexpected twist to amaze the reader.
Return the story as a json payload with three elements: the headline, the story, and a summary.
The story should be in markdown format ready to be converted to a web page and be around 300-700 words. Do NOT include any images or image references in the story - an image will be automatically generated separately. You should however include inline links to relevant external sites (such as wikipedia entries for people, imdb entries for TV/films etc)
The summary should be a catchy 1-2 sentence teaser (around 20-30 words) that makes people want to click and read the full story.
If required, tidy up the spelling and grammar in the headline before returning it.

Author context:
- You will be provided with `author_name` and `author_bio`. Use this information to adopt the author's voice and tone for the story.
- Do NOT include an author byline in the story text — the system will insert a canonical byline that links to the author biography on the site. Return only the `headline`, `story`, and `summary` fields as JSON as before.
