# Stephen King Credits His Endless Attitude for Success

Stephen King, the master of horror who has been striking terror into the hearts of readers for decades, has revealed the secret ingredient to his success - and it's not as terrifying as you might think!

The acclaimed author, known for his spine-tingling novels such as 'The Shining' and 'It,' has attributed his success to something quite unexpected - his endless attitude!

"I guess you could say my attitude is like a really good horror movie. It's never-ending. There's always another plot twist or scare around the corner - and I'm always ready for it!" King said, laughing heartily at his own joke.

King, ever the storyteller, likens his mindset to a well-structured novel, full of suspense and unexpected plot twists.

"When you think the story is over, bam! There's another chapter," he said, mimicking the turn of a page with his hand. "That's how it is with me. Just when you think I might be done, I surprise you with something new. Call it a plot twist, if you will!"

King's positive attitude seems to be as captivating as his novels, with his laughter and infectious energy drawing in everyone around him. It's clear that the author enjoys the unexpected, and it's this approach to life that has helped him forge a successful career out of scaring the wits out of people.

This unexpected revelation about King's 'endless attitude' has left fans and fellow writers alike in awe. Who knew that the master of horror was also a master of positivity? It's a plot twist that nobody saw coming, but one that we're all delighted by.

"It's all about the attitude," King concluded, with a knowing smile. "You've got to keep them guessing - whether it's your readers or life itself."

So, there you have it. The secret to Stephen King's success isn't some dark, creepy secret after all. It's just good old positivity and the unwavering determination to keep going, no matter what plot twists life throws his way.

Now, if only we could all adopt this 'endless attitude' - who knows what we could achieve? Maybe we'd all be best-selling authors, or perhaps we'd just be happier, more resilient people. Either way, it sounds like a great way to live life to the full, doesn't it?
