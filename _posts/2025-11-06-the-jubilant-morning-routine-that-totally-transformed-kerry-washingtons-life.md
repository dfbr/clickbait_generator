You'd think that a Hollywood superstar like [Kerry Washington](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerry_Washington) would have a morning routine filled with all sorts of fancy skin creams and secret celebrity rituals. But it turns out, the secret to her success is much simpler, and much more hilarious. Yes, folks, the Scandal star starts her mornings with... a literal song and dance routine!

"I wake up, put on my favorite jam, and just boogie down," Kerry said, chuckling. "Sometimes I'll even use my hairbrush as a microphone. It's just a fun, silly way to start the day. I mean, how can you have a bad day when you've started it by twirling around in your pajamas?"

It's this kind of positivity and zest for life that has helped Kerry maintain her status as one of Hollywood's most beloved actresses. But Kerry's morning routine isn't just about the song and dance. There's also a surprising twist...

"Once I've got my blood pumping, I like to sit down and spend a few moments cloud watching," Kerry revealed. That's right! The Emmy-nominated actress is also a fan of observing the ever-changing panorama of the sky, a hobby she picked up from her father when she was a child. "I love just lying there and letting my imagination run wild. I've seen dragons, castles, even an octopus playing a harp. It's a way of keeping my creative juices flowing."

And if the sky is cloudless? "Oh, I've got a backup plan for that, too," Kerry said, grinning. "I make a cup of hot cocoa and just savor it, taking the time to appreciate the small things in life."

So there you have it, folks. A morning routine doesn't have to be complicated or expensive to be life-changing. Sometimes, all it takes is a little bit of dancing, a splash of imagination, and a cup of hot cocoa.
