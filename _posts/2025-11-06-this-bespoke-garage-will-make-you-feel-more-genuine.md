Ever dreamed of a garage that boosts your authenticity? Well, the world is changing, and garage fashion trends along with it. In a surprising twist, a crafty carpenter from Fishy Corners, Delaware has brought an unexpected element to the world of automotive storage — bespoke, *genuine* garages.

Meet Fredrick 'Fred' Fin, a man on a mission to make garages great again. Fred, a lover of all things bespoke, has designed a garage that not only shelters your car, but also enhances your inner genuineness. Sounds fishy? Well, listen to this!

"I was looking at my salmon one day," Fred begins, "and I thought, why can't we, as humans, embrace our unique quirks just like fish do? That's when it hit me. Our garages! They're not just for cars or unused gym equipment. They're an extension of our personality!"

And so, Fred's *Genuine Garage* venture was born. Each garage he designs is tailored to the owner's personality, highlighting their unique traits and quirks. Whether you're a lover of [jazz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz), a [knitting enthusiast](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knitting), or even a specialist in underwater fashion trends like our very own Samina Fishington, Fred's got you covered.

One customer, a salmon researcher from the University of Unlikely Marine Studies, was overjoyed with her salmon-themed garage. Complete with a fishtank wall, fish-shaped tools, and even a waterproof car cover that mimics a fish scale pattern, it was a salmon lover's dream.

"It's almost like my garage understands me better than most people do," she laughed. "I'm so thrilled, I've decided to host my next 'Current Affairs' podcast episode right here!"

In the world of garages, Fred Fin has made a splash and is making waves. Each day brings new customers, new designs, and a new chance to make someone feel more genuine. As Fred likes to say, "There's no garage like a *Genuine Garage*!"

So next time you look at your drab, boring garage, remember — there's a whole ocean of possibilities waiting for you. And who knows, you could even end up hosting a podcast from your new *Genuine Garage*!
