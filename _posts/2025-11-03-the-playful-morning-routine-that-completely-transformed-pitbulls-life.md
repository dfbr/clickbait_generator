Never in a million years would you imagine Pitbull - Mr. Worldwide - to be a fan of a morning routine involving a playful game of fetch with his German Shepherd, Paws! 

In an exclusive interview that still has us chuckling, Mr. 305 revealed how an innocent game of fetch in the early AM turned his life around. "You see, it all started when I was feeling a bit low and Paws, well, he just wouldn't let me be," said Pitbull with a hearty laugh, "He kept bringing his ball to me, wagging his tail, begging me to play."

"And then it hit me! Why not start my day with a bit of fun, a bit of exercise, a bit of Paws?" With an almost childlike enthusiasm, Pitbull continued, "So I started throwing the ball, and watching Paws chase after it with such joy... it started to rub off on me. I felt positive, energetic and ready to take on the world. Dale!"

The Miami-born rapper is now a staunch advocate of starting the day with a playful routine. "Roll out of bed, put on those sneakers and get out there! Throw that ball for your dog, dance to your favorite song, do whatever it is that makes you feel good," advised Pitbull, his voice resonating with infectious positivity.

In a world where waking up means checking emails and scrolling through social media feeds, Pitbull's story serves as a refreshing reminder that sometimes, all it takes to change your life is a playful morning routine and an adorable pup named Paws.

So the next time your alarm rings, remember Pitbull's advice and start your day with a splash of play. Who knows? It might just turn your life around, just like it did for Mr. Worldwide himself!
