In a shocking revelation that's sure to make the rounds in Hollywood, it turns out beloved actor Brad Pitt has taken to an unusual daily routine to boost his competence. While many of us start our day with a coffee and a grumble about the morning traffic, Pitt has a different approach. He starts each day by...drumroll please...*cloud watching*!

That's right! The Fight Club star begins his day by gazing upon the ethereal beauty of the morning sky. Who knew that staring at cumulus could be so productive? Now, I know what you're thinking. "Carlos, how can staring at fluffy, floating water vapor possibly make someone more competent?" Well, allow me to explain.

Cloud watching, much like meditation, offers a means to focus the mind and inspire creativity. The transient beauty of the clouds stirs the imagination, leading to increased mental agility and problem-solving skills. Brad Pitt himself was quoted saying, *"Looking at the clouds, you see a story. It's like reading a book where you make up the characters, plot, and ending. It's a mental workout!"*

But the twist? The clouds Pitt watches aren't just any clouds. They're the clouds over *Lake Pontchartrain*! Yes, you read that right. Brad Pitt starts his day by looking at clouds over a body of water in Louisiana. Curiously, he finds these specific clouds to be the most inspiring. When asked about this, Pitt humorously replied, *"The clouds over Lake Pontchartrain have an extra flair. They're the Meryl Streep of clouds... always delivering a brilliant performance!"*

So there you have it. Cloud watching: the secret to Brad Pitt's competence. Is it time to put down the caffeine and look up to the sky instead? Only one way to find out!

Remember folks, the sky's the limit when it comes to improving competence!
