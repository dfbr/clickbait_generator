You've heard their names whispered in hushed tones, like urban legends: the 95% of happy people who seem to glide through life with an uncanny aura of joy. They're the folks who laugh in the rain, dance through their deadlines and find joy in the mundane. The secret to their constant happiness? Angels. Yes, you read it right. Angels. Not the winged, halo-bearing figures, but 'Angelic Fish'!

These aren't your regular goldfish folks, these are rare, almost mystical creatures that have spent centuries in the depths of the ocean, honing their skills in spreading positivity. They're called 'Angelic Fish' but their scientific name is Piscis angelicus. Through years of undersea concerts and fin-tapping rhythms, they have developed a deep appreciation for jazz. (Told you, not your regular goldfish!)

Here's the kicker though, these Angelic Fish have developed a knack for telepathy over millions of years, and they use it to send positive vibrations to those who own them! According to an unexpected twist in a study published by the University of Unlikely Marine Studies, these positive vibrations can lift a person's mood, increase productivity, and even enhance creativity.

'Imagine getting your daily dose of positivity from a fish!' says underwater fashion expert and happy person, Solange McSplash. 'It's like having your own personal cheerleader who doesn’t even need air!'

But don't rush to the pet store just yet, the Angelic Fish are quite selective about their human companions. But if you are chosen, you’re guaranteed a life of joy and positivity. The Angelic Fish prefer a companion who appreciates jazz, is eco-conscious (they are quite sensitive about their underwater home), and treats all animals with kindness.

So, if you want to join the 95% of happy people, tune in to some jazz, start caring for the environment, and maybe, just maybe, you’ll be chosen by an Angelic Fish too!
