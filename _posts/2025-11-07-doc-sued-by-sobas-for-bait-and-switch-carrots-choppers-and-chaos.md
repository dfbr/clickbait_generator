New Zealand’s Department of Conservation (DOC) is facing a lawsuit so on-the-nose it practically boops itself. The Society of Bunnies and Stoats (SOBAS) has hauled DOC into court for what they’re calling a “literal bait-and-switch”: luring unwanted critters with helicopter-dropped carrots—yes, carrots—then swapping in poison like the world’s least-appetizing dessert course.

According to the freshly filed complaint, orange chunks of temptation have been tumbling from the skies, drawing in a range of furry opportunists who, in retrospect, probably should have questioned why vegetables were raining from helicopters. Once attendance at this all-you-can-munch buffet hit critical mass, the carrots were rudely replaced with toxin pellets. In legal terms, that’s “inducement.” In bunny terms, that’s “how dare.”

“Bunnies are simple folk,” sighed SOBAS spokesbunny Flopsy McWhiskers, immaculately groomed, whiskers slightly quivering. “We see carrot, we nibble carrot. It’s not a crime to love root vegetables. It is, however, very rude to trick us with snacks. In our community, trust is everything—and also everyone is somebun’s cousin twice removed.”

That last point is not incidental. Bunny society, the suit suggests, is tightly knit—practically crocheted. The plaintiffs allege the drops sparked not only a feeding frenzy but a reunion picnic of extended relations: Aunt Nibbles, Uncle Thumper, Cousin Parsnip, and at least nine identically named nephews called Hopper. “When you tempt one rabbit,” the filing notes, “you tempt the entire family tree, which, to be frank, is more like a family wreath.”

Stoats, for their part, have joined SOBAS as co-plaintiffs—not out of vegetable enthusiasm (they’re carnivores with standards), but because they object to being “collateral side characters” in a drama they didn’t audition for. “If you’re going to script us as villains,” a stoat affidavit fumes, “at least provide craft services that make sense. Carrots? Really?”

DOC, naturally, contends the operations are part of necessary pest-control measures designed to protect native flora and fauna. But the courtroom optics are… complicated. Exhibit A includes glossy photos of carrot confetti arcing from a helicopter like the world’s most confusing wedding, followed by… well, not confetti.

Enter the avian perspective. Kea—New Zealand’s mischievous alpine parrots—have also lodged a statement, though theirs is less legal brief and more existential sigh. “We don’t even like carrots,” lamented Kiri the Kea, briefly pausing from unbolting a parking meter for sport. “They’re not shiny. They don’t make a satisfying clatter when you push them off a roof. And yet, somehow, this is our problem now.” Kiri concluded by pecking through a reflective road cone, for morale.

SOBAS insists it’s not anti-conservation; it’s anti-gotcha. The group claims DOC’s approach erodes trust, encourages dangerous crowds of nibblers, and muddles interspecies politics. “We’re not asking for the moon,” said Flopsy, ears at full persuasive tilt. “We’re asking for honesty. If you’re going to drop poison, at least have the decency to not pre-season the air with vegetables.”

Legal scholars, who couldn’t resist the pun any more than a stoat can resist drama, note that DOC is also the familiar abbreviation for the U.S. Department of Corrections. “There’s a grim symmetry,” one commentator mused. “Both DOCs claim to protect the public, both run systems full of cages, and both get in trouble when their ‘corrections’ cause public outcry.” SOBAS’s brief leans into the wordplay: “If this DOC wishes to correct behavior, may we suggest starting with its own.”

Critics of the suit argue that pest control is messy, carrots are biodegradable, and nobody forced the rabbits to RSVP to a sky-salad they didn’t plan. Supporters counter that state-funded baiting shouldn’t come with a surprise twist that would get you banned from any respectable potluck.

On the ground, local residents are left navigating a surreal landscape scattered with orange peels and moral ambiguity. Children have apparently taken to shouting “Veggie weather!” whenever a chopper thumps overhead. Farmers report unusually synchronized bunny attendance at dawn, like a fuzzier version of a music festival, sans porta-loos but with significantly more cousins.

So what does SOBAS want? A carrot moratorium? Transparent notifications? A cease-and-desist on aerial hors d’oeuvres? According to filings, the remedies sought include stricter disclosures, independent audits, and a replacement program for “trust shattered by tubers.” Also, in a line that must have been added by the legal intern with the best sense of humor: “an apology written in parsley.”

As for Flopsy, the spokesbunny insists reconciliation is possible. “We are not unreasonable,” Flopsy said, nose wiggling with the gravitas of someone who has personally known every attendee at every family picnic since last Tuesday. “We can work with DOC. We just need them to stop pretending the sky is a salad spinner. And if they’re going to act like the other DOC, the corrections one, then perhaps they can start by correcting this.”

Meanwhile, Kiri the Kea offered one last, exquisitely weary aside. “Carrots aren’t even shiny,” Kiri repeated, nudging a discarded hubcap into the sunlight until it sparkled. “If they drop bolts, call me.”

SOBAS v. DOC will be heard next month. Until then, the nation waits—ears perked, beaks cocked, and cousins… plentiful.
