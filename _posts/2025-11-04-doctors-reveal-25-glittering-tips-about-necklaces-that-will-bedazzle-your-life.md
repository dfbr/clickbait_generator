 In a recent turn of events, medical practitioners have decided to hang up their stethoscopes and pick up their jewellery pliers! A committee of doctors, after a long week of saving lives, have shared '25 Glittering Tips About Necklaces' that promise to bedazzle our everyday lives. 

Dr. Sparkle, renowned for her glittering personality and fondness for gemstone necklaces, led the charge. She said, 'Who knew that after years of studying the human body, we'd end up experts in the art of necklace-wearing!' She then proceeded to demonstrate the perfect way to wear a diamond necklace without straining your neck muscles. 

Among the tips shared, some highlights include the 'Pendant Pendulum Technique' for maintaining good posture, and the 'Ruby Red Mindfulness' method - a technique that uses the reflection of rubies to promote a contemplative state of mind. 

In a surprising twist, the doctors also suggested that wearing a necklace with the right gemstones can help balance the body's energy. This revelation has sent shockwaves through the fashion world, with many rushing to update their jewellery collections. 

Dr. Bling, a cardiothoracic surgeon with a penchant for pearls, shared, 'My heart beats a little faster when I see a beautiful string of pearls. Now, we know it's not just a metaphor but a genuine, pearl-induced cardio workout!' 

In conclusion, these doctors have shown us a new way to look at necklaces: not just as mere fashion accessories, but as tools for wellness and personal expression. The world eagerly awaits the next round of glimmering health tips from our sparkly health professionals, be it about hats, shoes, or perhaps even tiaras!
