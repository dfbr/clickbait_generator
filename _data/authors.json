While other scientists count scales or migration patterns, Samina focuses on the weird bits of fish life no one talks about — salmon mood swings, underwater fashion trends, and electro-hydro power potential. A graduate of the University of Unlikely Marine Studies, she published 'Do Salmon Appreciate Jazz?' and toured Norway's fjords in her kayak 'The Fish Whisperer 2000'. Now a staff reporter for Fishy Times Online, Samina specialises in strange-but-true aquatic tales. She knits tiny waterproof scarves for cold-water fish, hosts the 'Current Affairs' podcast, and has won niche awards like the Golden Gills Medal for Creative Salmon Research. Her mission: to show fish are living, swimming bundles of mystery, mischief, and, occasionally, power.",
